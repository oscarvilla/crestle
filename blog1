I was a time following the the Victor's suggestions on the previous blog, so that I have news:


1. The first thing I realized it's that you can close the tab, the browser, even your laptop (desktop, whatever), then open again session in other location and your "jupyter notebook" will be still running there. So, that's mean you can start a model training, close your laptop, go away, and open again from wherever.

2. If you are following the fast.ai great course, and you do want to run it on Crestle, you need to run lesson1's notebook first, because the crestle crew did put there some chunks of code in order to: - replace the Keras version from the default to 1.2.2. which is used on the course (Thought in the forum Nurag says "Fast.ai notebooks preinstalled in your account are already set up to work with keras 1.2.2, and you install it as part of lesson 1: https://github.com/anurag/crestle-fastai/blob/master/deeplearning1/nbs/lesson1.ipynb")

3. Then you need to fix the path to the data: path = "/datasets/fast.ai/dogscats/"). There in "/datasets/fast.ai" there are even the models downloaded.

4. If you run jupyter notebooks as is with just CPU (not GPU enabled), you will have issues with Theano because some requirements will be not satisfied. But you can take a chunk of code from other Crestle's notebook to fix it: 

!mkdir -p ~/.keras
!echo '{"epsilon":1e-07,"floatx":"float32","backend":"theano", "image_dim_ordering": "th"}' > ~/.keras/keras.json

That's some kind of acces to bash from jupyter notebook, like Jeremy Howard explained in lesson2 video.

5. I think we need to run some kind of benchmarking, because I perceive Crestle more slow than Floydhub at training. Someone says in the fast.ai's forum that's because of the backend of the file transfer, so that the ImageGenerator method from Keras will take a long.

6. If you are following the Dogs vs cats redux solutions which people have run on AWS, will doesn't run just as is. 
You have to fix the paths to data and solve a problem about directories structure: inside "test" set directory there have to be other called "unknown". That's because the ImageGenerator method from Keras used in the .test method, use the the last part of the path as the category. 

so, we need to:

6.1. Start a jupyter notebook on Crestle without enable GPU (if you don't want to waste your GPU time) 

6.2. When the notebook is running, start a terminal session by clicking on the ">_new terminal" button (if you make it from notebook the file transfer will take longer)

- on "/courses/fastai/deeplearning" or whichever directory you have write acces, create a dir called "unknown" inside other called "test". You can do it by typing: 

mkdir ~/courses/fastai/deeplearning1/test, 

- and then 

mkdir ~/courses/fastai/deeplearning1/test/unknown.

- now copy all the photos inside of "/datsets/fasta.ai/dogscats/test" to the directory just created (~/courses/fastai/deeplearning1/test/unknown). You can do it by typing:

cp -a /datsets/fasta.ai/dogscats/test/* ~/courses/fastai/deeplearning1/test/unknown.

This will take a long. But when you run 

batches, preds = vgg.test(path+'test', batch_size=batch_size*2)

you'll see the message

Found 12500 images belonging to 1 classes.
