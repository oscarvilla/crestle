I was a time following the 

1. You can close the tab, even your laptop (desktop, whatever) then open again session in other location and your notebook will be still running there. So that you can start a model training, close your laptop and go away, and open again from wherever.

2. You need to run lesson1 notebook first, because the crestle crew put there some chunks of code in order to:
	- replace the Keras version from the default to 1.2.2. which is used on the course. Thought in the forum Nurag says "Fast.ai notebooks
	preinstalled in your account are already set up to work with keras 1.2.2, and you install it as part of lesson 1: https://github.com/anurag/
	crestle-fastai/blob/master/deeplearning1/nbs/lesson1.ipynb"
	- fix the path to path = "/datasets/fast.ai/dogscats/"

3. in /datasets/fast.ai there are even the models downloaded

4. If you run just CPU (not GPU enable) will have issues with Theano, some requirements not satisfied (I got the print screen saved).

5. We need to run some kind of benchmarking, because I perceive crestle more slow than floydhub at training... Someone says in the fast.ai forum that's because the file transfer's back end, so that the ImageGenerator take a long.

6. 4096 --> 0.94 acc
   5696 --> 0.9533 acc
   9920 --> 9620 acc
That's just a manual note down of the number of cases trained vs accuracy.

7. Dogs vs cats redux notebook doesn't run just as is. You have to fix the paths to data ... and the problem about known folder inside test one: the ImageGenerator method, used in the .test method, use the path as category. I think so.
---------------------------------------------------------------
1. Start a jupyter notebook without enable GPU
2. When in, start a ">_new terminal" (Personally, I did have to erase the directories that the notebook created 
before on courses directorie). Then you do need to:

- on /courses/fastai/deeplearning or whichever dir you have write acces, create a dir "unknown" inside other called "test". 
In my case typed: mkdir ~/courses/fastai/deeplearning1/test, and then mkdir ~/courses/fastai/deeplearning1/test/unknown.
- now copi all the photos inside of /datsets/fasta.ai/dogscats/test to the directorie just created 
(~/courses/fastai/deeplearning1/test/unknown). 
I did it by typing: cp -a /datsets/fasta.ai/dogscats/test/* ~/courses/fastai/deeplearning1/test/unknown. 
This will take a long.
