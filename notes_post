1. Start a jupyter notebook without enable GPU
2. When in, start a ">_new terminal" (Personally, I did have to erase the directories that the notebook created 
before on courses directorie). Then you do need to:

- on /courses/fastai/deeplearning or whichever dir you have write acces, create a dir "unknown" inside other called "test". 
In my case typed: mkdir ~/courses/fastai/deeplearning1/test, and then mkdir ~/courses/fastai/deeplearning1/test/unknown.
- now copi all the photos inside of /datsets/fasta.ai/dogscats/test to the directorie just created 
(~/courses/fastai/deeplearning1/test/unknown). 
I did it by typing: cp -a /datsets/fasta.ai/dogscats/test/* ~/courses/fastai/deeplearning1/test/unknown. 
This will take a long.
